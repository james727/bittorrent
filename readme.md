#BitPy
BitPy is a lightweight, terminal-based BitTorrent client written in Python. Usage is as follows:

```python main.py <filename>
```

##Example usage:
Assuming there is a file named `file.torrent` stored in the same directory as BitPy, usage would be like this:

```python main.py file.torrent
```

You should then see a screen like this:

BitPy will create a `Downloads` folder within its working directory to store all torrent downloads. Each torrent file will receive its own folder within `Downloads` named the same thing as the main torrent filename.

##Features
BitPy currently has support for:
- Up to 30 peers at once (as recommended by the BitTorrent specification)
- Multifile downloads
- Pausing and resuming of downloads (it creates a temporary `status.txt` file during download that is uses to check progress if the download is halted for any reason)
- HTTP and UDP trackers

##TODO
There are several features that we haven't built yet, but would like to. These include:
- [ ] Re-querying the tracker for new peers every 15 minutes (or interval specified by the tracker)
- [ ] Support for seeding other files during downloads.
- [ ] Making a spiffier download bar.
- [ ] Dropping slow peers.
